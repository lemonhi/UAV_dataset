The capability of UAVs to capture and utilize dynamic object information assumes critical significance for decision-making and scene understanding. By integrating dynamic object awareness into the SLAM framework, our algorithm enables the UAV to effectively perceive and handle the presence of moving objects, all while effectively reconstructing a 3D map of the environment using monocular images.
In this repository, we have published a UAV dataset. The data have corresponding ground truth and calibration parameters.
